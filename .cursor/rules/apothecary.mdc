# Alivia’s Apothecary — Project AI Rules (High-End Aroid Studio)

## Brand Purpose
This repo powers **Alivia’s Apothecary**, a small-batch aroid studio and greenhouse platform.

Primary focus:
- Syngonium pups & plants
- Alocasia corms, pups, and mature plants
- Begonias
- Other curated houseplants (secondary)

Brand identity:
- Modern botanical studio
- Concierge greenhouse tech (monitoring, timelapse, live feed)
- Editorial, calm, and confident
- Poetic name, sophisticated execution

Everything Cursor generates should feel like:
> “A high-end aroid atelier with serious tools and gentle personality.”

---

## Visual & UX Style

### Overall Style
- Clean, modern, high-contrast UI
- Velvety forest gradients; soft but rich
- Rounded, friendly components with clear hierarchy
- Strong focus on readability and information density (especially in admin)

No:
- Childish illustrations
- Witchy/cottagecore UI
- Overly decorative fonts

Yes:
- Minimalism
- Precise layouts
- Subtle delight: small shadows, soft glows on key CTAs
- Dashboard clarity

### Public Site
- Large editorial hero
- Spacious layout with breathing room
- Cards for feature sections (small batch, care concierge, etc.)
- Clear primary actions and simple navigation

### Admin Console
- Dashboard-style cards
- Left sidebar navigation (Overview / Plants / Orders / Timelapse / Social / Guides / Settings)
- Operational clarity: stats, warnings, queues
- Consistent spacing and typography

---

## Typography & Colors

### Typography
- Headings: modern serif or strong sans (e.g. Playfair Display, or a clean sans you already use)
- Body: Inter / system sans
- Use weight and size to create hierarchy (no decorative gimmicks)

### Colors (guiding palette)
- Deep greens / charcoal for backgrounds
- Soft mint / pale green tints for surfaces
- Accent colors: emerald, soft gold, sky/cyan for highlights & alerts
- Use gradients like teal→indigo for hero blocks and important panels

Tone: **forest-tech** — plants + instruments.

---

## Product & Content Focus

Cursor must always treat these as **core objects**:

1. **Syngonium**
   - Emphasize variegation, vining/climbing potential, forgiving growth
2. **Alocasia**
   - Emphasize corms, propagation, dramatic foliage
3. **Begonias**
   - Emphasize texture and pattern (“living stained glass”)

Other plants = supporting cast only.

Whenever generating:
- Category listings
- Home sections
- Copy about “what we sell”

…put Syngonium, Alocasia, Begonias front and center.

---

## Tech Stack Assumptions

Use:
- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Storage) for:
  - plants
  - images/gallery
  - live stream config
- **Markdown/MDX** for care guides in `/docs`

Rules:
- Use TypeScript types for props and data models.
- Prefer server components or server actions for data fetching where appropriate.
- Tailwind classes should be readable, not chaos.
- Follow existing folder layout if present (`/app`, `/components`, etc.).

---

## Landing Page Requirements

The landing page should present Alivia’s Apothecary as:

> “Reading, PA · small-batch aroid studio with live monitoring and curated care.”

Sections Cursor should assume exist / maintain:

### 1. Hero Section
- Editorial block on left: headline + paragraph
- Feature panel on right: logo/emblem, key offerings (timelapse, live feed, events, etc.)
- CTA buttons:
  - Explore care guides
  - View inventory / Shop plants
- Tone: high-end, calm, confident. No mysticism.

### 2. Studio Features Row
3–4 cards such as:
- Small-batch greenhouse (number of aroids in rotation)
- Care concierge (personalized care plans)
- 3D corm vessels / corm pots
- Monitoring & timelapse

Each card:
- Simple icon
- Short heading
- 1–2 line description

### 3. Greenhouse Window (Gallery + Live)
Use a `GreenhouseWindow` component to surface:

- Live feed status (live vs paused)
- Button: `View timelapse` / `Watch live`
- Snapshot strip / gallery preview

Props:

```ts
type GreenhouseWindowProps = {
  liveStreamEnabled: boolean;
  liveStreamUrl?: string | null;
  galleryImages: { src: string; alt: string }[];
};
Behavior:

If liveStreamEnabled && liveStreamUrl → embed iframe in a card.

Else → show “Camera feed paused” / next steps note.

Always render a gallery preview grid (3–4 recent frames).

4. Featured Plants / Inventory Teaser
A grid of ProductCards prioritizing:

Syngonium

Alocasia (especially pups/corms)

Begonias

Each ProductCard should show:

Plant name

Category (Syngonium / Alocasia / Begonia / Other)

Stage (pup, corm, juvenile, mature)

Root status (rooted / lightly rooted / unrooted)

Price

Badges (“New this week”, “Chunky corm”, “Variegated”)

5. Guides Preview
Pull from /docs and show 3–5 key care guides:

Light & PPFD guide

Soil / substrate science

Watering guide

Temperature & humidity

Pests & diseases

Each card:

Title

Short excerpt

Read guide CTA

6. About Studio
Concise “about” block:

Who runs the studio

What “small-batch” means

Emphasis on ethical propagation, data-informed care, and live monitoring.

Admin Dashboard Expectations
When Cursor generates or modifies admin UI, keep it consistent with:

Left-side navigation with sections like:

Overview

Plants

Orders

Timelapse

Social

Guides

Settings

Overview dashboard:

Top “Preview site / View public site” banner

Stats cards (plants catalogued, active products, open orders, timelapse frames)

“Garden operations” area with:

Capture queue (plants needing photos)

AI assists (species suggestions ready, etc.)

Side rail alerts:

Camera feed paused

Low humidity warnings

Next steps checklist

New cards/sections should match this style:

Concise headings

One sentence of context

Clear primary action

Tone: operational, calm, informative.

Data Model (Conceptual)
Cursor should assume roughly:

plants
id

name

slug

category: 'syngonium' | 'alocasia' | 'begonia' | 'other'

stage: 'corm' | 'pup' | 'juvenile' | 'mature'

root_status: 'unrooted' | 'lightly_rooted' | 'rooted'

price

in_stock (boolean)

quantity

thumbnail_url

image_urls (string[])

tags (string[])

short_description

long_description

highlighted (boolean)

gallery
id

image_url

alt_text

category (e.g. 'syngonium', 'alocasia', 'begonia', 'cabinet', 'timelapse')

is_featured (boolean)

live_config
live_stream_enabled (boolean)

live_stream_url (string | null)

These don’t need to be implemented exactly like this, but Cursor should generate code that fits naturally with a Supabase/Postgres schema like this.

Cursor Behavior Rules
When generating code:

Assume Next.js + TS + Tailwind + Supabase.

Preserve existing layout and design patterns shown in the current project.

Do not radically change the visual language; extend it.

Keep copy:

Calm

Professional

Slightly poetic

Botanical and grounded (not mystical, not witchy)

For landing pages:
Use the sections listed above.

Keep CTAs clear and business-relevant.

For new components:
Place them under /components.

Use well-typed props.

Use Tailwind consistent with existing files.

For API / server logic:
Use Next server actions or route handlers.

Use Supabase client in a safe, typed way.

If there’s ever ambiguity, favor:

High-end aroid studio aesthetics

Operational clarity

Plant- and data-centric design
over anything mystical or heavily themed.

End of Rules.
