# Pests & Diseases — Alocasia & Syngonium

Healthy plants start with healthy roots and environment, but even the best setups occasionally attract pests or disease. This guide covers **common issues, early signs, and treatment strategies** tailored to Alocasia and Syngonium.

---

## 1. General Principles

1. **Early detection is everything.**  
2. Most pests target **stressed plants** first.  
3. Combining **mechanical removal**, **topical treatments**, and **environmental changes** is more effective than any single approach.

## 2. Common Pests

### 2.1. Spider mites

**Who they love:**  
- Alocasia, especially in **dry air**  
- Some Syngoniums, especially variegated ones

**Signs:**

- Fine speckling on leaves (tiny pale dots)
- Very fine webbing between petioles and undersides of leaves
- Leaves may look dull or dusty

**Treatment:**

1. Rinse foliage thoroughly in the shower or with a sprayer.  
2. Apply **insecticidal soap** or **horticultural oil** to both sides of leaves, following label directions.  
3. Repeat every 5–7 days for at least 3 cycles (to catch new hatchlings).  
4. Increase humidity and improve airflow; extremely dry air worsens mite outbreaks.

### 2.2. Thrips

**Signs:**

- Silvery streaks or lines on leaves
- Tiny dark specks (frass) near damage
- Distorted new growth

**Treatment:**

- Remove heavily damaged leaves.
- Use **sticky traps** to monitor and reduce adults.
- Apply systemic insecticide where legal/appropriate or rotate:
  - insecticidal soap  
  - horticultural oil  
  - biologicals (e.g., certain entomopathogenic fungi)
- Maintain consistent treatment cycles over several weeks.

### 2.3. Mealybugs

**Signs:**

- White, cottony clusters at leaf axils, roots, or petiole bases
- Sticky honeydew residue
- Stunted new growth

**Treatment:**

1. Dab visible mealybugs with cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol (spot treatment).  
2. Follow with broader spray (insecticidal soap or oil) if population is significant.  
3. Inspect roots for root mealybugs if infection persists despite foliar treatment.

---

### 2.4. Fungus gnats

**Mostly a symptom**, not the core problem.

**Signs:**

- Small black flies around soil surface
- Larvae in top few centimeters of soil

**Causes:**

- Constantly wet, organic-heavy mixes

**Treatment:**

- Allow top layer of soil to dry more between waterings.
- Use sticky traps for adults.
- Consider biological control:
  - *Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis* (BTi) drenches  
  - Predatory nematodes

## 3. Disease & Physiological Issues

### 3.1. Root & corm rot (very common in Alocasia)

**Causes:**

- Overwatering in dense or cold soil
- Poor drainage
- Cold + wet conditions

**Signs:**

- Foul odor from soil
- Mushy, brown/black roots
- Softened corms
- Rapid yellowing and collapse of leaves

**Response:**

1. Unpot plant and inspect roots/corm.  
2. Trim all mushy tissue with sterile tools.  
3. Dust cuts with fungicide or cinnamon as a mild option.  
4. Repot into **fresh, airy mix**.  
5. Adjust watering habits and environmental conditions.

---

### 3.2. Edema / water imbalance

**Signs:**

- Blisters or translucent patches on leaves
- Often appears after sudden change in watering or humidity

**Causes:**

- Roots absorbing water faster than leaves can transpire
- Often in cool, wet conditions or after heavy watering followed by low transpiration

**Management:**

- Adjust watering schedule
- Increase airflow
- Slightly reduce humidity or temp differential

---

### 3.3. Leaf spot diseases (fungal/bacterial)

**Signs:**

- Spots with defined borders, sometimes with halos
- Spots that spread, coalesce, or cause tissue death
- Sometimes associated with overhead watering + poor airflow

**Management:**

- Remove heavily affected leaves with sterilized scissors.
- Improve airflow and avoid leaving water sitting on leaves overnight.
- In persistent or severe cases, consider fungicides (according to local regulations and label instructions).

---

## 4. Nutrient & Environmental “Fake Diseases”

These look like disease but are environmental/physiological.

### 4.1. Brown tips and edges

Common causes:

- Low humidity
- Salt buildup in soil
- Chronic underwatering followed by heavy watering

Management:

- Improve humidity and watering consistency.
- Occasionally flush soil with plain water.
- Trim worst damage if desired (cosmetic).

---

### 4.2. Interveinal chlorosis (pale between veins)

Possible causes:

- Nutrient imbalance (iron or magnesium)
- pH too high for uptake
- Overly frequent fertilization without proper balance

Management:

- Check fertilization schedule.
- Use a balanced fertilizer with micronutrients.
- Consider occasional use of iron chelate if pH and other factors suggest deficiency.

---

### 4.3. Variegation confusion

Variegated Syngonium leaves naturally have:

- White/cream areas with fewer chloroplasts
- More susceptibility to burn
- Slower growth on highly variegated sections

Important:

- Don’t mistake normal variegation for disease.
- Brown patches on variegated sections often indicate **light burn or stress**, not pathogens.

---

## 5. Quarantine & Hygiene

For collections or business operations:

1. **Quarantine new arrivals** for 2–4 weeks.
2. Inspect weekly for pests or fungal issues.
3. Use separate tools or sterilize between plants, especially when trimming.
4. Avoid reusing potting mix from unknown or sick plants.
