# Alivia’s Apothecary — Aroid Care Booklet

Welcome to **Alivia’s Apothecary**.  
This booklet is your quick-reference guide to caring for the Alocasia, Syngonium, and other tropical treasures you’ve adopted from us.

You can read it like a spellbook: a mix of science, observation, and a little bit of houseplant magic.

---

## 1. Light

Most aroids like:

- **Bright, indirect light**
- No harsh midday direct sun directly on leaves (especially variegated ones)

Quick rules:

- East or bright north windows: usually ideal.
- South or west: pull plants back from the glass or diffuse with sheer curtains.
- Deep interior rooms: consider a **full-spectrum grow light**.

If you’re using lux or PPFD meters:

- Many of our Alocasia and Syngonium are happiest around:
  - **80–200 µmol/m²/s PPFD**
  - Roughly **5,000–15,000 lux** for white light sources

---

## 2. Watering

**General rule:**  
Let the top **1–3 cm (0.5–1")** of soil dry, then water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom.

- Don’t let the pot sit in water long-term.
- Don’t water by schedule alone; feel the soil and lift the pot.

Signs to water:

- Top feels dry.
- Pot feels noticeably lighter.
- Leaves are just beginning to look a bit less perky (but not fully limp).

If in doubt:

- It is usually safer to **wait one more day** than to overwater, especially in cool/low light conditions.

## 3. Soil & Pots

Your plant likely arrived in an **airy aroid mix** that balances:

- Drainage  
- Air pockets  
- Moisture retention

If repotting:

- Use a pot with drainage holes.
- Choose a high-quality aroid or indoor mix with added bark and perlite.
- Only size up 1–2 inches wider than the current root ball.

---

## 4. Temperature & Humidity

These plants are tropical at heart.

- Ideal temperature range: **20–27°C (68–80°F)**
- They can tolerate typical indoor humidity, but do best **above 50% RH**.

Tips:

- Keep away from cold windows in winter.
- Avoid placing directly in the path of AC or heating vents.
- Humidifiers, grouping plants, and greenhouse cabinets all help.

---

## 5. Feeding (Fertilizer)

In the active growing season (spring through early fall):

- Use a balanced houseplant fertilizer at **¼–½ strength** every 2–4 weeks.
- Occasionally flush the pot with plain water to avoid salt buildup.

In winter or low-light periods:

- Reduce or pause feeding if growth slows significantly.

---

## 6. Common Symptoms & Simple Fixes

### Yellowing leaves (older leaves first)

- Normal aging if occasional.
- If many at once:
  - Check for overwatering.
  - Check for root issues.

### Brown tips and edges

- Often related to:
  - Low humidity
  - Irregular watering
  - Salt buildup

Adjust watering rhythm, consider raising humidity, and periodically flush the soil.

### Slow or no growth

- Common in winter or low-light seasons.
- Also happens after shipping stress.
- Make sure light and temperature are appropriate, then give the plant time.

## 7. Pests

We do our best to send out healthy plants, but houseplants can still encounter pests like spider mites, thrips, or fungus gnats.

Basic response:

- Inspect leaves (especially undersides) regularly.
- If you see webbing, speckling, or insects:
  - Gently rinse foliage.
  - Use insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, following label directions.
  - Repeat as needed.

You can always reach out to us with clear photos if you’re unsure — we’re happy to help identify and troubleshoot.

## 8. Shipping Shock & Acclimation

Your plant has traveled and changed environments quickly. Mild symptoms can include:

- Slight droop
- Minor yellowing of 1–2 leaves
- Minor mechanical damage

Help it settle by:

1. Placing it in **bright, indirect light**.
2. Avoiding immediate repotting (unless there is a clear emergency like severe rot).
3. Watering only when the top of the soil has dried.
4. Giving it 2–4 weeks to adjust before making major changes.

---

## 9. When to Repot

Consider repotting when:

- Roots are circling heavily.
- Water runs straight through without being retained at all.
- You see roots coming out of the bottom and plant dries too quickly.

Ideal times:

- Spring and early summer.
- Avoid repotting during severe stress or deep winter unless necessary.

---

## 10. Contact & Support

If you have questions or concerns about your plant’s health:

- Take a clear photo of the whole plant.
- Take close-ups of affected leaves and the soil surface.
- Note your:
  - Light source and distance
  - Watering pattern
  - Recent changes (repotting, moving, etc.)

We’re always happy to help you interpret what your plant is “saying.”
