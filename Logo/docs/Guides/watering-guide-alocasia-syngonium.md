# Watering Guide — Alocasia & Syngonium

Watering is where “plant intuition” meets physics.  
Roots need **oxygen and moisture** at the same time. This guide keeps it simple and precise for both beginners and pros.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Frequency is not the main variable** — *drying time is.*
2. The right time to water depends on:
   - Substrate composition  
   - Pot size and material  
   - Temperature & humidity  
   - Light intensity  
   - Plant age and root mass

We don't water by **calendar**. We water by **readings**:

- Feel of the substrate  
- Weight of the pot  
- Response of the plant

## 2. Watering Alocasia

Alocasias dislike:

- Being constantly waterlogged  
- Fully drying out for long periods  
- Cold, wet soil

### 2.1. General rhythm

- Allow the **top 2–4 cm (1–1.5")** of mix to dry.
- Below that, keep slightly moist.
- In high-aeration mixes, watering may be more frequent; that's expected.

### 2.2. By age / stage

**Corms & tiny sprouts**

- Goal: lightly moist, never soggy.
- Use a fine but airy medium (fluval, pon, moss blend).
- Water when the top feels just barely dry; avoid heavy saturation.

**Juvenile Alocasia**

- Smaller pots dry faster; check every 2–3 days.
- Lift the pot and learn the “light when dry, heavy when moist” weight.
- Water thoroughly until a bit drains from the bottom, then let excess drain away.

**Mature Alocasia**

- Larger root systems drink more, but also fill the pot.
- In bright light and warmth, they'll use water faster.
- Use consistent, deep watering with drying of the upper layer between waterings.

### 2.3. Signs of underwatering (Alocasia)

- Limp leaves that perk dramatically after watering
- Crispy edges on newer leaves
- Very dry, pulling-away-from-pot soil

### 2.4. Signs of overwatering

- Yellowing of oldest leaves first
- Mushy petiole bases
- Sour or swampy odor from soil
- Corm turning soft instead of firm

When unsure, check the root zone:

- White/tan, firm roots = healthy
- Brown/black, mushy roots = rot

## 3. Watering Syngonium

Syngoniums are more forgiving but still benefit from intentional watering.

### 3.1. General rhythm

- Let the **top 1–3 cm (0.5–1")** dry.
- Water thoroughly; empty any standing water from cache pots.
- In medium-light conditions, this often lines up with every 4–7 days, but conditions matter more than the number.

### 3.2. By age / stage

**Cuttings / newly rooted pieces**

- Propagation in water: change water regularly; keep nodes submerged, leaves above water.
- In substrate: keep evenly lightly moist until well-rooted, then let top layer dry between waterings.

**Juvenile Syngonium**

- Slightly moist, not constantly wet.
- Responds well to deep watering followed by partial drying.

**Established vining / climbing Syngonium**

- Larger biomass = higher water use.
- On moss poles, monitor moisture of both pot and pole.
- Consistent moisture leads to fuller foliage and larger leaf size.

---

### 3.3. Signs of underwatering (Syngonium)

- Dramatic droop of entire plant
- Leaves feel thin and papery
- Quick recovery after watering

### 3.4. Signs of overwatering

- Yellow lower leaves that don’t perk after watering
- Mushy stems near the soil line
- Persistent wetness and fungus gnats

---

## 4. Water Quality

### 4.1. Tap water

Most Alocasias and Syngoniums tolerate normal tap water fine, but:

- Very hard water can lead to leaf tip burn and salt buildup.
- Chlorine is rarely an issue; chloramine can be more persistent.

If in doubt or in very hard water areas:

- Let tap sit for 24 hours (chlorine off-gasses, not chloramine).
- Consider mixing tap with distilled or RO for sensitive species.

### 4.2. Distilled / RO water

Pros:

- Clean, no salts
- Good for flushing or sensitive roots

Cons:

- Contains **no nutrients**
- Requires consistent fertilization & supplementation of Ca/Mg over time

A compromise for pros:

- 50:50 tap : RO mix
- Balanced fertilizer including Ca, Mg, micronutrients

## 5. Seasonal Adjustments

### 5.1. Winter / low-light period

- Lower temps + lower light = slower transpiration.
- Let the substrate dry **more** before watering.
- Reduce fertilizer frequency.

### 5.2. Summer / high-light period

- More light, more heat, more active growth.
- Substrate dries faster.
- Watering frequency increases; fertilizer can be slightly more frequent (still diluted).

---

## 6. Practical Techniques

### 6.1. Bottom watering

Good for:

- Rehydrating dry soil
- Ensuring even moisture

Method:

1. Place nursery pot in a shallow tray.
2. Fill tray with water up to ~1/3 height of pot.
3. Wait 15–30 minutes.
4. Remove, let excess drain.

Don’t leave pots standing in water long-term.

### 6.2. Moisture meters

- Can be helpful in very dense or large pots.
- Better used as **trend tools**, not single absolute readings.
- Always cross-check with feel and weight.

---

## 7. Water Strategy Summary

**Alocasia:**

- Airy mix; never soggy; avoid full desiccation.
- Keep evenly moist below a dry top layer.
- Very sensitive to cold + wet combination.

**Syngonium:**

- Slightly more moisture-tolerant.
- Top layer dry between waterings, core lightly moist.
- Great candidate to practice consistency and learn pot-weight cues.
