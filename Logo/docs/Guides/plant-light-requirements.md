# Light Requirements — Alocasia & Syngonium (By Age)

Plant age dramatically affects how much PPFD a leaf can safely use.  
Younger leaves = fewer chloroplasts = lower tolerance.

Below are safe, growth-optimizing ranges for **Alocasias** and **Syngoniums**.

These values are indoor-focused, not greenhouse values.

## 🌿 Alocasia — PPFD by Age + Stage

Alocasias are a **high-variation** group but share similar physiology:

- Thick petioles  
- Large lamina  
- High sensitivity to rapid light/temp swings  

### Corm Stage → Sprout (Week 0–3)

- **PPFD:** 20–60 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux estimate:** 1,200–4,000 lux  

Explanation: Just-rooting tissues are light-sensitive; low light encourages elongation of early petioles without burning tender tissues.

---

### Juvenile Plant (Small leaves 2–4")

- **PPFD:** 60–120 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 4,000–9,000  

Explanation: Young leaves still underdeveloped; moderate light drives photosynthesis without stress.

---

### Adolescent (5–8" leaves)

- **PPFD:** 100–180 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 7,000–14,000  

This is the sweet spot for growth without stressing most species.

---

### Mature Alocasia (8"+ leaves)

- **PPFD:** 150–250 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 10,000–18,000  

High but controlled light thickens leaves, deepens color, and increases leaf size.

---

### High-Light Tolerant Species

Examples: **Alocasia Frydek, Dragon Scale, Silver Dragon**

- **PPFD:** 200–300 µmol/m²/s  

With airflow + consistent moisture, these species thrive at the higher end.

---

### Signs of Too Much Light (Alocasia)

- Crispy edges  
- Pale or bleached patches  
- Hard, slowed leaves  
- Tight, “crunched” growth

### Signs of Too Little Light

- Long petioles reaching toward light  
- Tiny or deformed new leaves  
- Weak corm growth  
- Slow or no new foliage

---

## 🌿 Syngonium — PPFD by Age + Stage

Syngoniums tolerate a wide range of light.  
They adapt well and rarely scorch unless exposed to direct sun.

### Cuttings / Unrooted Nodes

- **PPFD:** 20–60 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 1,200–4,000  

Low-stress environment encourages rooting before the plant carries a heavy photosynthetic load.

---

### Juvenile (small arrowhead leaves)

- **PPFD:** 60–120 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 4,000–9,000  

Great for compact, bushy growth.

---

### Established Plants (vining)

- **PPFD:** 100–180 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 7,000–14,000  

Ideal for most varieties.

---

### Variegated Syngonium (e.g., Albo, Mojito)

- **PPFD:** 120–200 µmol/m²/s  
- **Lux:** 8,000–16,000  

Higher PPFD helps maintain variegation.  
White tissue burns easily; avoid harsh direct sun.

---

### Mature Climbing Syngonium (on pole)

- **PPFD:** 150–250 µmol/m²/s  

Stimulates larger, more mature leaf forms and fenestration (in certain cultivars).

---

## 🌞 DLI Targets for Both Genera

- **Survival:** 5–10 mol/m²/day  
- **Healthy indoor growth:** 10–20 mol/m²/day  
- **High-performance growth:** 18–25 mol/m²/day (requires strong grow lights)
