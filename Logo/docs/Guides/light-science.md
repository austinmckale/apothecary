# Light Science Guide — Alivia’s Apothecary

Plants don’t see light the way we do.  
They don’t care how “bright” something *looks* — they care how many **photosynthetic photons** hit their leaves each second.

This guide explains **what light plants use**, **how to measure it**, and **how much Alocasias and Syngoniums need at different ages**.

## 🌈 What Light Plants Actually Use (PAR & Wavelengths)

**PAR – Photosynthetically Active Radiation**  
The wavelength band **400–700 nm** where plants do most photosynthesis.

Inside PAR:

### Blue light (400–500 nm)

- Drives compact growth  
- Thickens leaves  
- Strengthens petioles  
- Too much alone can stress tender species

### Green light (500–570 nm)

- Less absorbed at the surface  
- Penetrates deeper into the canopy  
- Helps lower leaves photosynthesize

### Red light (600–700 nm)

- Most efficient wavelength for photosynthesis  
- Promotes leaf expansion and biomass  
- Critical in indoor growing environments

### Far-red (700–750+ nm)

Not part of PAR, but influences:

- Stretching  
- “Shade avoidance” responses  
- Can increase vertical growth if over-emphasized

For Alocasias and Syngoniums, the goal is **blue for structure**, **red for fuel**, **green for canopy penetration**, and **very little far-red** unless intentionally shaping growth.

## 🌞 Lux vs PPFD vs DLI (The Important Part)

### Lux (lx)

- How bright light looks to *humans*  
- What phone apps measure  
- Not a true plant metric  
- Still useful for estimating

### PPFD (µmol/m²/s)

**PPFD = the actual number of photosynthetic photons hitting a leaf.**  
This is the most important measurement for growers.

### DLI (mol/m²/day)

Daily Light Integral  
→ PPFD integrated over 24 hours.  
→ Think of it as your plant’s *daily total photon meal*.

### PPF (µmol/s)

How many photons a light *produces*.  
Useful for comparing bulbs, not for measuring the plant’s actual experience.

## 🧮 Estimating PPFD from Lux (Good Enough for 90% of Home Growers)

White LED / daylight approximation:

**PPFD (µmol/m²/s) ≈ lux ÷ 60–75**

Examples:

- 3,000 lux → ~45–50 PPFD  
- 7,000 lux → ~95–115 PPFD  
- 12,000 lux → ~160–200 PPFD

This is simplified, but reliable enough for deciding plant placement.

## 📚 Light Categories (Indoor Aroid Reality)

| Category   | PPFD (µmol/m²/s) | Lux (approx) | Meaning                                  |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Very Low  | 10–30             | 500–2,000    | Shelves away from windows; survival only |
| Low–Medium| 30–80             | 2,000–5,000  | Works for Syngoniums, some shade Alocasia|
| Medium    | 80–150            | 5,000–10,000 | Good aroid growth                        |
| Med–High  | 150–300           | 10,000–20,000| Fast growth, larger leaves               |
| High      | 300–600           | 20,000–40,000| Strong grow light / greenhouse levels    |

## 🧪 How to Measure Light (Beginner → Pro)

### Method A — Phone Apps (free & surprisingly effective)

1. Download any **lux meter** app.  
2. Place your phone where your **leaf sits**, not the pot rim.  
3. Point the top of the phone **straight upward**.  
4. Record:
   - Morning  
   - Midday  
   - Afternoon  

Convert using:

```text
PPFD (µmol/m²/s) ≈ lux ÷ 60–75
```

Good enough to map your house’s light profile.

---

### Method B — Actual PAR / PPFD Meters (accurate)

Use a quantum sensor or PPFD meter:

1. Hold the sensor at **leaf height**.  
2. Take readings across the shelf.  
3. Average them or record the brightest value (your choice).  

These meters directly show **µmol/m²/s**.

This is what professional growers, greenhouses, and serious collectors use.

---

### Method C — Light Mapping Ritual

1. Choose 3–5 spots per shelf.  
2. Measure PPFD or lux.  
3. Create a **shelf map** like:

```text
Front Left: 115 PPFD
Front Right: 95 PPFD
Back Left: 70 PPFD
Back Right: 55 PPFD
```

4. Place fussier Alocasias in the brightest consistent zones.  
5. Place Syngoniums in mid-range pockets.  
6. Reserve lower PPFD spots for cuttings and propagations.
