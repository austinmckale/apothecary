# Soil & Substrate Science — Alivia’s Apothecary

Indoor aroids like **Alocasias** and **Syngoniums** evolved with roots in loose, living forest material — not dense potting mud. This guide explains how to build mixes that breathe, drain, and still hold enough moisture for consistent growth.

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. What roots actually need

Roots care about three things more than anything else:

1. **Oxygen** — roots respire; without air pockets, they suffocate.
2. **Water** — enough to stay hydrated, not so much that water replaces air.
3. **Anchoring** — a structure that holds the plant upright and stable.

Most problems with Alocasias and Syngoniums start in the root zone:  
too wet, too airless, too cold, or too salty.

### 1.2. Key substrate properties

- **Drainage**  
  How fast water moves through and exits the pot.  
  Poor drainage = standing water = root rot risk.

- **Aeration**  
  Air spaces between particles.  
  Created by chunky materials like bark and perlite.

- **Water-holding capacity**  
  How much moisture the mix can retain between waterings.  
  Coco, peat, and fine organics increase this.

- **CEC – Cation Exchange Capacity** (lightly)  
  A measure of how well a medium holds onto nutrients like Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺.  
  Organic matter and clays have higher CEC; pure perlite has nearly zero.

For aroids, we want **high aeration + moderate water-holding + moderate CEC**.

## 2. Recommended Mixes

These recipes are starting points. Adjust for your climate and watering style.

### 2.1. Alocasia Mix (More Air, Less Risk)

For potted plants in typical indoor conditions:

- **30–40%** high-quality potting soil (peat or coco-based)
- **25–35%** chunky bark (orchid bark or similar)
- **20–30%** perlite or pumice
- **0–10%** worm castings or compost (optional; use sparingly)

This creates:

- Many air pockets  
- Fast drainage  
- Enough moisture between waterings

If your environment is:

- **Dry / hot indoor air:**  
  Increase potting soil or add a bit of coco coir.
- **Cool / low light / heavy hand with water:**  
  Increase perlite / bark; reduce peat/coco.

---

### 2.2. Syngonium Mix (Forgiving but Still Airy)

Syngoniums tolerate more diversity in soil. A mix that works for most:

- **40–50%** potting soil
- **20–30%** perlite/pumice
- **20–25%** bark
- **5–10%** amendments (castings, charcoal, etc.)

This mix:

- Holds more moisture than the Alocasia mix  
- Still drains well  
- Is suitable for both bushy and climbing plants

---

### 2.3. Semi-Hydro / Inorganic Options

Common media:

- **LECA** (clay balls)
- **PON / synthetic aroid mixes**
- **Fluval Stratum / baked clays**

Pros:

- Excellent aeration
- Easy to inspect roots
- Less fungus gnat pressure

Cons:

- Nutrients must be supplied via solution
- Sensitive to inconsistent water levels and salts

Good for:

- Propagation  
- Controlled collections  
- People who enjoy measuring and dialing in details

## 3. Pot Choice & Shape

### 3.1. Drainage holes are non-negotiable

- At least one large hole; multiple is better.
- Decorative cash pots are fine, but plant should live in a **nursery pot with holes** inside.

### 3.2. Pot size

- **Too big:** mix stays wet longer → root rot risk.
- **Too small:** dries too fast, root binding over time.

Ideal:

- New pot diameter only **2–5 cm (1–2 inches)** larger than the current root mass.

### 3.3. Corm / propagation pots

For Alocasia corms:

- Slightly narrower, deeper containers
- High aeration
- Side perforations or air-pruning styles can help encourage fibrous root systems

(Perfect use case for **custom 3D-printed corm pots**.)

---

## 4. pH & Nutrient Interactions (Simple but Useful)

Most aroids prefer substrate pH around **5.5–6.5**.

- Above ~7.0:  
  Iron and some micronutrients become less available → chlorosis.
- Below ~5.0:  
  Some nutrients become overly available or toxic; root stress can occur.

High-organic aroid mixes + typical tap water usually stay in a friendly range.  
If you see persistent pale new growth:

- Check for overwatering first.
- Then consider micronutrient deficiencies or high pH.

## 5. Soil Problems & Diagnostics

### 5.1. Compaction

Symptoms:

- Water sits on top before soaking in  
- Pot feels heavy long after watering  
- Stems wobble but roots don’t expand

Fix:

- Repot into a mix with more bark and perlite
- Loosen root ball gently, remove dead roots

---

### 5.2. Hydrophobic soil

Peat-based soils can become water-repellent when bone dry.

Symptoms:

- Water runs down the sides and out the bottom immediately
- Root ball inside is still dry

Fix:

- Bottom-water for 20–30 minutes
- Or water slowly in small passes
- In future, water before it dries completely to this state

---

### 5.3. Salt buildup

Symptoms:

- Crunchy, brown tips  
- White crust on soil or pot rim  
- Plant is being fertilized regularly

Fix:

- Flush pot thoroughly with plain water
- Occasionally repot with fresh mix
- Use lower fertilizer concentration

## 6. Substrate Strategy by Plant Type

### 6.1. For Alocasia

- Prioritize **air + drainage**.
- Use **less peat/coco** than you think you need.
- Keep substrate **evenly moist** but never waterlogged.
- Combine with a **warm root zone** (heating mat on low, in some cases).

### 6.2. For Syngonium

- Slightly more moisture-retentive mix is fine.
- Better tolerance for imperfect watering.
- For climbing forms, keep substrate airy enough to avoid stem rot near the base.
