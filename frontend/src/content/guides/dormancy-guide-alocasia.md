# Dormancy & Rest Periods — Alocasia (and Friends)

Not every leaf loss is a tragedy; sometimes it’s just a **seasonal spell**.  
This guide explains **dormancy behavior in Alocasia**, how to tell rest from decline, and how to care for corms during quiet periods.

## 1. What is Dormancy?

Dormancy is a programmed **slowdown or pause** in growth triggered by:

- Lower light  
- Cooler temperatures  
- Shorter days  
- Stress (shipping, repotting, root loss)

For Alocasia, dormancy often means:

- Dropping some or all leaves
- Retreating to the corm
- Reducing water usage dramatically

---

## 2. Triggers of Dormancy in Alocasia

Common triggers:

- **Seasonal change** (autumn/winter indoors)
- Sudden **drop in temperature**
- Major **root disturbance** or rot
- Significant **drop in light intensity**

Not all Alocasias go fully dormant indoors. Some just slow their growth.

## 3. How to Tell Dormancy from Decline

### Dormancy clues:

- Leaves yellow off gradually; plant drops them in an orderly way.
- Corm remains **firm** when squeezed.
- No foul smell from the pot.
- Root system mostly pale and firm, even if smaller.

### Decline/rot clues:

- Rapid collapse of leaves.
- Mushy petioles at soil level.
- Corm feels soft or partially hollow.
- Sour or rotten smell.

If unsure, gently unpot and inspect the corm and roots.

## 4. Caring for Dormant or Leafless Corms

### 4.1. Moisture management

For a dormant, leafless Alocasia with a firm corm:

- Keep the substrate **slightly barely moist**, never fully saturated.
- Allow the top layer to dry completely.
- Water very lightly and infrequently — the root system is not actively pulling much water.

If the environment is **cool and dark**, even less water is needed.

---

### 4.2. Temperature during dormancy

- Keep corms around **18–24°C (64–75°F)** if possible.
- Avoid drops below ~15°C (59°F) for extended periods.
- Warmer root zones encourage earlier sprouting.

---

### 4.3. When to wake a corm

Dormant corms will often resprout when:

- Light increases (spring or under brighter grow lights)
- Temperature rises
- Moisture is slightly increased

You can encourage awakening by:

- Moving pot to a **warmer, brighter** location.
- Ensuring substrate is fresh and well-draining.
- Gently increasing watering when you see buds forming.

---

## 5. Split Corms and Propagation During Dormancy

When unpotting a dormant plant:

- You may find multiple corms offset from a mother corm.
- These can sometimes be gently separated and potted individually.
- Each corm should be:
  - Firm
  - Free of mushy or black tissue
  - Planted in a small pot with airy mix or propagation substrate

Keep newly separated corms:

- Warm
- Slightly moist
- In low–moderate light until foliage emerges

---

## 6. Syngonium & “Resting,” Not True Dormancy

Syngoniums usually don't go fully dormant indoors but can **slow down**:

- Fewer or smaller new leaves in winter
- Slight pause after heavy pruning or repotting

Care adjustments:

- Reduce watering
- Maintain stable temps and light
- Resume more active feeding when new growth resumes strongly

---

## 7. When to Cut Losses

A corm is likely non-viable if:

- It is completely soft or hollow.
- It disintegrates when cut open.
- There is pervasive mold and rot throughout after trimming.

If only part is rotten:

1. Cut back to firm, clean tissue.  
2. Treat cut surface (fungicide or dry/cinnamon).  
3. Let callus briefly (a few hours) before replanting in slightly moist medium.

---

## 8. Psychological Note (for caretakers)

Dormancy can feel like a failure if you’re used to always-green houseplants.  
For Alocasia, leaf loss and rest are sometimes just part of their rhythm — especially in temperate homes.

Markers of success:

- You keep the **corm alive**.
- It wakes and pushes new growth in the next active season.
