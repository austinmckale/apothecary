# Temperature & Humidity Guide — Alivia’s Apothecary

This guide explains how **temperature and humidity** drive growth, stress, and disease in Alocacias, Syngoniums, and other tropical houseplants.

## 1. Temperature Basics

Aroids are generally adapted to **warm, stable understory conditions**.

### 1.1. General ranges (indoor aroids)

- **Ideal growth**: 20–27°C (68–80°F)
- **Acceptable**: 18–30°C (64–86°F)
- **Stress zone**: below 16°C (60°F) or above 32°C (90°F) for long periods

### 1.2. Night vs day

A small day–night drop is natural:

- Day: ~22–27°C (72–80°F)
- Night: ~19–22°C (66–72°F)

Sharp drops (e.g. window drafts in winter) can trigger:

- Leaf yellowing  
- Sudden collapse of tender leaves  
- Dormancy in Alocasia

## 2. Humidity Basics

Aroids use **stomata** to balance water loss and gas exchange.  
Dry air forces them to close stomata more often, reducing growth.

### 2.1. General ranges

- **Minimum tolerated**: ~35–40% RH  
- **Comfortable**: 50–70% RH  
- **High humidity**: 70–85% RH (great for growth, but manage airflow)

Alocasia tends to be more sensitive to **low humidity** than Syngonium, especially velvety or thin-leafed species.

## 3. Combined Temperature & Humidity Effects

### 3.1. Warm + dry

- Faster evaporation from soil and leaves.
- Increased need for watering.
- Higher risk of brown tips and edges, especially on Alocasia.

### 3.2. Cool + wet

This is the **dangerous combination**:

- Slower root metabolism.
- Water lingers in substrate.
- Dramatically higher risk of root/corm rot.

Avoid:

- Watering heavily late at night in a cool room.
- Placing Alocasia in cold rooms where soil never really warms.

### 3.3. Warm + humid + stagnant air

- Great for growth *if* airflow is good.
- Poor airflow increases risk of:
  - fungal leaf spots  
  - bacterial issues  
  - edema-like symptoms

Use:

- Small fans for gentle circulation.
- Avoid direct fan blast at leaves; think “moving air mass,” not “wind tunnel.”

## 4. Target Ranges by Plant Type

### 4.1. Alocasia

**Juveniles & corms**

- Temp: 22–28°C (72–82°F)
- Humidity: 60–80% RH
- Strongly prefer consistent warmth at root level.

**Mature Alocasia**

- Temp: 20–27°C (68–80°F)
- Humidity: 50–70% RH
- Can handle slightly drier air if watering and substrate are well managed.

### 4.2. Syngonium

**Juveniles**

- Temp: 20–26°C (68–79°F)
- Humidity: 50–70% RH

**Mature vines / climbers**

- Temp: 18–27°C (64–80°F)
- Humidity: 40–70% RH
- More tolerant of average household environments.

## 5. Practical Ways to Adjust Environment

### 5.1. To raise humidity

- Humidifier with built-in hygrometer
- Group plants together (shared transpiration)
- Use greenhouse cabinets or propagation boxes for sensitive plants
- Place plants away from heating vents and strong AC

### 5.2. To manage overheating

- Sheer curtains to diffuse strong afternoon sun
- Move plants away from direct sun patches on hot days
- Increase air movement with fans

### 5.3. To avoid cold damage

- Move plants away from single-pane windows in winter
- Avoid placing pots directly on cold tile floors (use stands or mats)
- Check for drafts near doors and windows

## 6. Symptoms of Temperature/Humidity Stress

### 6.1. Cold stress

- Limp or translucent patches on leaves
- Sudden collapse after a drafty night
- Stalled growth, leaves emerging deformed

### 6.2. Heat stress

- Leaves curling inward
- Dry, crispy edges despite adequate watering
- Rapid soil drying, drooping by late afternoon

### 6.3. Low humidity stress

- Brown tips on thinner leaves
- Edges crisping, especially on Alocasia
- Increased spider mite pressure

## 8. Seasonal Strategy

**Winter:**

- Light is weaker; temps drop.  
- Emphasize stable temperatures and **avoid cold + wet**.  
- Reduce watering and feeding frequency; watch for drafts.

**Summer:**

- Brighter and warmer; plants can use more water and nutrients.  
- Increase airflow, monitor for pests, and ensure humidity doesn’t drop too low from constant AC.
