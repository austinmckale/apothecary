# The Studio Standard: Aroid Care

Welcome to the Alivia’s Apothecary collection.
This guide outlines the protocols we use in our Reading, PA greenhouse to maintain the health of high-value aroids.

While every environment is unique, these principles of light, hydration, and substrate will help your specimen transition from our benches to your home.

## 1. Light & Energy

We grow our Syngonium and Alocasia under precise conditions. To maintain their variegation and vigor, aim for **bright, indirect illumination**.

### The Metrics
If you utilize light meters (lux or PPFD), target these ranges:
- **PPFD:** 80–200 µmol/m²/s
- **Lux:** 5,000–15,000 (broad spectrum white light)

### Positioning
- **East/North Windows:** Often ideal for soft, consistent light.
- **South/West Windows:** Diffuse with sheer curtains to prevent foliar scorch.
- **Grow Lights:** Essential for deep interiors. Position 12–24 inches above the canopy depending on intensity.

## 2. Hydration Strategy

Avoid rigid schedules. Aroids prefer a "listen and respond" approach.

**The Protocol:**
Allow the top **2–3 cm (1 inch)** of substrate to dry before irrigation. When you do water, saturate the medium fully until runoff occurs, then ensure all excess drains away.

**Signs to Water:**
- Substrate surface is dry to the touch.
- Pot weight is noticeably lighter.
- Foliage shows early signs of softening (avoid waiting for full wilt).

**Note:** It is safer to delay watering by one day than to saturate a wet root ball.

## 3. Substrate Composition

Your plant is potted in our custom aroid blend, engineered for:
1. **Aeration:** Roots require oxygen to prevent pathogens.
2. **Drainage:** Water must flow freely.
3. **Retention:** Bark and moss hold just enough moisture for uptake.

**Repotting:**
We recommend waiting 2–4 weeks after arrival before repotting. When you do, choose a chunky, airy mix (orchid bark, perlite, coco coir) and increase pot size by no more than 1–2 inches.

---

## 4. Environment

These specimens are tropical by nature but adaptable.

- **Temperature:** 65–80°F (18–27°C). Avoid cold drafts or heat vents.
- **Humidity:** 50% RH or higher is preferred. Alocasias particularly benefit from elevated humidity (60%+), but can acclimate to standard room conditions over time.

---

## 5. Nutrition

We feed with a balanced, water-soluble nutrient solution.

- **Active Season (Spring/Summer):** Dilute fertilizer to 50% strength every other watering.
- **Dormancy (Winter):** Reduce frequency or pause if growth arrests.

---

## 6. Pest Management

We employ rigorous integrated pest management (IPM) in the studio, but vigilance is key in any collection.

**Routine:**
Inspect the undersides of leaves and petioles weekly.

**Common Vectors:**
- **Spider Mites:** Look for fine webbing or stippling.
- **Thrips:** Look for silver streaks or tiny, moving larvae.

**Response:**
Isolate the specimen. Treat with a gentle horticultural oil or insecticidal soap solution, ensuring full coverage.

## 7. Acclimation

Transit is stressful. Your plant may exhibit minor "travel fatigue" such as a lower leaf yellowing or slight droop.

**Recovery Protocol:**
1. Unbox immediately and inspect.
2. Place in a warm spot with moderate, indirect light.
3. Do not repot immediately.
4. Allow the root system to settle for 14 days.

For specific concerns, please reference the species-specific guides or contact the studio for a consultation.
