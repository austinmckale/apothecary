## 1. Preformulated MS Media Options

### 1.1. Plant Cell Technology MS "Modification 9"

**Best for:** Versatile, complete formulation

- **Includes:** All macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, and glycine
- **Packaging:** Homogenous, free-flowing powder (bottle or pouch)
- **Cost:** ~$12.99 for 5 L (larger sizes available at lower cost per liter)
- **Usage:** 4.4 g powder per 1 L of distilled water for full-strength MS
- **Notes:** Complete formulation — no separate vitamin supplement needed. Dissolves partially at room temperature; may require heating/autoclaving for full dissolution.

### 1.2. Budget-Friendly Bulk Options

**For larger volumes (10–50 L):**

- **PhytoTech Labs:** ~$9.20 for 10 L pack, ~$36.45 for 50 L pack
- **25 L jars:** Available in ~$40–$72 range (approximately $1.50–$3 per liter)
- **Best value:** Bulk purchases bring cost down to well under $1 per liter

**For convenience (single-use packets):**

- **Pre-measured 1 L packets:** ~$9–$10 per packet (e.g., Research Products International)
- **Pros:** No weighing needed, easy to use
- **Cons:** Higher cost per liter — best for occasional use

### 1.3. Ready-Mixed Complete Media

**Maximum convenience (higher cost):**

- **Complete blends:** Include MS salts, vitamins, sucrose, and agar premixed
- **Example:** Boca Hydro MS mix — simply add powder to water and sterilize
- **Cost:** ~$6–$10 per liter of prepared medium
- **Best for:** Home labs without precise scales (though buying components separately is cheaper)

## 2. Hormone Additives for Cloning

Successful tissue culture requires **plant growth regulators (PGRs)** added to the base MS medium. The key hormones are:

- **Cytokinin** (BAP) — induces shoot proliferation
- **Auxins** (IBA or NAA) — induce rooting and sometimes callus formation

---

## 3. 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) — Cytokinin for Shoots

BAP promotes cell division and shoot formation, breaking apical dominance to encourage multiple shoots from explants.

### 3.1. BAP Powder (Most Economical)

- **Cost:** ~$15.99 for 5 g (Plant Cell Technology, 99% purity)
- **Usage:** Typical concentrations are 0.5–2.0 mg per liter
- **Stock solution:** Make a 1 mg/mL (1000 ppm) stock by dissolving 100 mg BAP in a small volume of 1 N NaOH or 70% ethanol, then bringing to 100 mL with distilled water
- **Storage:** Powder is stable long-term if stored dry at 15–30°C. Stock solutions can degrade — make fresh every few months or store aliquots frozen

### 3.2. BAP Pre-made Solutions

- **Convenience option:** Ready-to-use sterile solutions (e.g., Caisson Labs BAP 1 mg/mL)
- **Cost:** ~$15–$20 for 100 mL
- **Best for:** Avoiding powder handling and stock solution preparation

### 3.3. Recommended BAP Concentrations

- **Shoot induction (Alocasia):** 1–3 mg/L (shoot tip culture protocols often use 3 mg/L)
- **Shoot proliferation (Begonia, Syngonium):** 0.5–2.0 mg/L
- **General micropropagation:** Start with 1 mg/L and adjust based on species response

## 4. Auxins for Rooting — IBA and NAA

### 4.1. Indole-3-Butyric Acid (IBA)

**Most commonly used for rooting:**

- **Form:** Available as powder or pre-made solution (1 mg/mL)
- **Cost:** ~$12–$15 for 100 mL solution (PlantMedia/Bio-World)
- **Usage:** Add to rooting medium at 0.5–1.0 mg/L
- **Stock solution:** Can make 1 mg/mL stock similar to BAP (dissolve in small amount of ethanol or KOH, then dilute with water)

### 4.2. Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA)

**Alternative auxin, sometimes used in combination:**

- **Effective for:** Some Begonia protocols use NAA alongside BAP for shoot induction
- **Rooting:** Similar concentrations to IBA (0.5 mg/L typical)
- **Availability:** Available as powder or solution from tissue culture suppliers

### 4.3. Recommended Auxin Concentrations

- **Rooting medium:** 0.5 mg/L IBA or NAA
- **Delicate species:** May benefit from half-strength MS for rooting stage
- **Alocasia rooting:** 0.5 mg/L IBA on full-strength MS works well

## 5. Complete Media Preparation Steps

### Step-by-Step Protocol for 1 Liter Batch

**Ingredients needed:**
- MS basal salts with vitamins: **4.4 g**
- Sucrose: **30 g**
- Agar: **7 g** (6–8 g range acceptable)
- Hormone stock solutions (BAP for shoots, IBA/NAA for roots)
- Distilled or deionized water: **1 L**

**Procedure:**

1. **Measure MS powder:** Weigh 4.4 g of MS basal salts (with vitamins)
2. **Measure sucrose:** Weigh 30 g of table sugar or lab-grade sucrose
3. **Measure agar:** Weigh 7 g of agar powder
4. **Combine dry ingredients:** Mix MS powder, sucrose, and agar in a clean flask or beaker
5. **Add water:** Pour in 1 L of distilled water
6. **Heat to dissolve:** Heat on stovetop or in microwave, stirring until all components dissolve (typically 50–60°C)
7. **pH adjustment:** Check pH (MS medium is typically around 5.7–5.8; adjust with KOH or HCl if needed, though often not necessary)
8. **Dispense into containers:** Pour into culture jars, test tubes, or Petri dishes (or keep in bulk flask for later pouring)
9. **Sterilize:** Autoclave at 121°C for 15–20 minutes, or use pressure cooker/microwave method for home labs
10. **Add hormones (after cooling slightly):** Once medium cools to ~50°C, add hormone stock solutions:
    - **Shoot medium:** Add BAP to 1 mg/L (e.g., 1 mL of 1 mg/mL stock per liter)
    - **Rooting medium:** Add IBA or NAA to 0.5 mg/L (e.g., 0.5 mL of 1 mg/mL stock per liter)
    - For smaller containers, calculate proportionally (e.g., 25 μL for a 25 mL jar)
11. **Pour or finalize:** If sterilized in bulk, pour into sterile Petri dishes/jars while warm (~50°C). If pre-dispensed, tighten lids after sterilization
12. **Solidify:** Let cool at room temperature for 30–60 minutes until agar sets into firm gel

**Storage:** Keep sealed containers at room temperature or refrigerated. Use within a few weeks for optimal results, though properly sealed media can last longer.

## 6. Typical Workflow for Aroids

### 6.1. Shoot Induction Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **BAP 1–3 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Break apical dominance, induce multiple shoots from explants
- **Duration:** 4–8 weeks (transfer to fresh medium every 4 weeks)

### 6.2. Shoot Proliferation Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **BAP 0.5–1.0 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Multiply shoot clusters
- **Duration:** Continue until sufficient plantlets for rooting

### 6.3. Rooting Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS (or half-strength for delicate species) + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **IBA 0.5 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Develop robust root systems
- **Duration:** 4–6 weeks until roots are 2–3 cm long

### 6.4. Acclimatization

- **Transfer:** Move plantlets from sterile culture to non-sterile conditions
- **Process:** Gradually reduce humidity, introduce to ambient conditions
- **Timeline:** 2–4 weeks before moving to standard potting mix
