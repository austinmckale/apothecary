# Tissue Culture Media Guide — MS Medium for Home Labs

**Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium** is the foundation of plant tissue culture. This guide covers budget-friendly options for preformulated MS media, hormone additives, and step-by-step preparation for cloning Alocasias, Syngoniums, and Begonias at home.

---

## 1. Preformulated MS Media Options

### 1.1. Plant Cell Technology MS "Modification 9"

**Best for:** Versatile, complete formulation

- **Includes:** All macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, and glycine
- **Packaging:** Homogenous, free-flowing powder (bottle or pouch)
- **Cost:** ~$12.99 for 5 L (larger sizes available at lower cost per liter)
- **Usage:** 4.4 g powder per 1 L of distilled water for full-strength MS
- **Notes:** Complete formulation — no separate vitamin supplement needed. Dissolves partially at room temperature; may require heating/autoclaving for full dissolution.

### 1.2. Budget-Friendly Bulk Options

**For larger volumes (10–50 L):**

- **PhytoTech Labs:** ~$9.20 for 10 L pack, ~$36.45 for 50 L pack
- **25 L jars:** Available in ~$40–$72 range (approximately $1.50–$3 per liter)
- **Best value:** Bulk purchases bring cost down to well under $1 per liter

**For convenience (single-use packets):**

- **Pre-measured 1 L packets:** ~$9–$10 per packet (e.g., Research Products International)
- **Pros:** No weighing needed, easy to use
- **Cons:** Higher cost per liter — best for occasional use

### 1.3. Ready-Mixed Complete Media

**Maximum convenience (higher cost):**

- **Complete blends:** Include MS salts, vitamins, sucrose, and agar premixed
- **Example:** Boca Hydro MS mix — simply add powder to water and sterilize
- **Cost:** ~$6–$10 per liter of prepared medium
- **Best for:** Home labs without precise scales (though buying components separately is cheaper)

---

## 2. Hormone Additives for Cloning

Successful tissue culture requires **plant growth regulators (PGRs)** added to the base MS medium. The key hormones are:

- **Cytokinin** (BAP) — induces shoot proliferation
- **Auxins** (IBA or NAA) — induce rooting and sometimes callus formation

---

## 3. 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) — Cytokinin for Shoots

BAP promotes cell division and shoot formation, breaking apical dominance to encourage multiple shoots from explants.

### 3.1. BAP Powder (Most Economical)

- **Cost:** ~$15.99 for 5 g (Plant Cell Technology, 99% purity)
- **Usage:** Typical concentrations are 0.5–2.0 mg per liter
- **Stock solution:** Make a 1 mg/mL (1000 ppm) stock by dissolving 100 mg BAP in a small volume of 1 N NaOH or 70% ethanol, then bringing to 100 mL with distilled water
- **Storage:** Powder is stable long-term if stored dry at 15–30°C. Stock solutions can degrade — make fresh every few months or store aliquots frozen

### 3.2. BAP Pre-made Solutions

- **Convenience option:** Ready-to-use sterile solutions (e.g., Caisson Labs BAP 1 mg/mL)
- **Cost:** ~$15–$20 for 100 mL
- **Best for:** Avoiding powder handling and stock solution preparation

### 3.3. Recommended BAP Concentrations

- **Shoot induction (Alocasia):** 1–3 mg/L (shoot tip culture protocols often use 3 mg/L)
- **Shoot proliferation (Begonia, Syngonium):** 0.5–2.0 mg/L
- **General micropropagation:** Start with 1 mg/L and adjust based on species response

---

## 4. Auxins for Rooting — IBA and NAA

### 4.1. Indole-3-Butyric Acid (IBA)

**Most commonly used for rooting:**

- **Form:** Available as powder or pre-made solution (1 mg/mL)
- **Cost:** ~$12–$15 for 100 mL solution (PlantMedia/Bio-World)
- **Usage:** Add to rooting medium at 0.5–1.0 mg/L
- **Stock solution:** Can make 1 mg/mL stock similar to BAP (dissolve in small amount of ethanol or KOH, then dilute with water)

### 4.2. Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA)

**Alternative auxin, sometimes used in combination:**

- **Effective for:** Some Begonia protocols use NAA alongside BAP for shoot induction
- **Rooting:** Similar concentrations to IBA (0.5 mg/L typical)
- **Availability:** Available as powder or solution from tissue culture suppliers

### 4.3. Recommended Auxin Concentrations

- **Rooting medium:** 0.5 mg/L IBA or NAA
- **Delicate species:** May benefit from half-strength MS for rooting stage
- **Alocasia rooting:** 0.5 mg/L IBA on full-strength MS works well

## 5. Complete Media Preparation Steps

### Step-by-Step Protocol for 1 Liter Batch

**Ingredients needed:**
- MS basal salts with vitamins: **4.4 g**
- Sucrose: **30 g**
- Agar: **7 g** (6–8 g range acceptable)
- Hormone stock solutions (BAP for shoots, IBA/NAA for roots)
- Distilled or deionized water: **1 L**

**Procedure:**

1. **Measure MS powder:** Weigh 4.4 g of MS basal salts (with vitamins)
2. **Measure sucrose:** Weigh 30 g of table sugar or lab-grade sucrose
3. **Measure agar:** Weigh 7 g of agar powder
4. **Combine dry ingredients:** Mix MS powder, sucrose, and agar in a clean flask or beaker
5. **Add water:** Pour in 1 L of distilled water
6. **Heat to dissolve:** Heat on stovetop or in microwave, stirring until all components dissolve (typically 50–60°C)
7. **pH adjustment:** Check pH (MS medium is typically around 5.7–5.8; adjust with KOH or HCl if needed, though often not necessary)
8. **Dispense into containers:** Pour into culture jars, test tubes, or Petri dishes (or keep in bulk flask for later pouring)
9. **Sterilize:** Autoclave at 121°C for 15–20 minutes, or use pressure cooker/microwave method for home labs
10. **Add hormones (after cooling slightly):** Once medium cools to ~50°C, add hormone stock solutions:
    - **Shoot medium:** Add BAP to 1 mg/L (e.g., 1 mL of 1 mg/mL stock per liter)
    - **Rooting medium:** Add IBA or NAA to 0.5 mg/L (e.g., 0.5 mL of 1 mg/mL stock per liter)
    - For smaller containers, calculate proportionally (e.g., 25 μL for a 25 mL jar)
11. **Pour or finalize:** If sterilized in bulk, pour into sterile Petri dishes/jars while warm (~50°C). If pre-dispensed, tighten lids after sterilization
12. **Solidify:** Let cool at room temperature for 30–60 minutes until agar sets into firm gel

**Storage:** Keep sealed containers at room temperature or refrigerated. Use within a few weeks for optimal results, though properly sealed media can last longer.

## 6. Typical Workflow for Aroids

### 6.1. Shoot Induction Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **BAP 1–3 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Break apical dominance, induce multiple shoots from explants
- **Duration:** 4–8 weeks (transfer to fresh medium every 4 weeks)

### 6.2. Shoot Proliferation Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **BAP 0.5–1.0 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Multiply shoot clusters
- **Duration:** Continue until sufficient plantlets for rooting

### 6.3. Rooting Stage

- **Medium:** Full-strength MS (or half-strength for delicate species) + 30 g/L sucrose + 7–8 g/L agar + **IBA 0.5 mg/L**
- **Purpose:** Develop robust root systems
- **Duration:** 4–6 weeks until roots are 2–3 cm long

### 6.4. Acclimatization

- **Transfer:** Move plantlets from sterile culture to non-sterile conditions
- **Process:** Gradually reduce humidity, introduce to ambient conditions
- **Timeline:** 2–4 weeks before moving to standard potting mix

### 7.2. Individual Component Cost Breakdown

**Detailed pricing comparison across major suppliers:**

| Component (quantity) | Amazon | Plant Cell Technology | PhytoTech Labs | Carolina Biological |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MS Medium** (10 L, with vitamins) | ~$27 (RPI 44 g pack) | ~$12.99 (small pack) | **$9.20** (10 L pack) | $26.20 (10 × 1 L packs) |
| **Agar** (100 g, tissue-culture grade) | ~$30 (lab-grade, various sellers) | $28.99 | $31.05 | ~$30 (educational grade) |
| **BAP solution** (100 mL, 1 mg/mL) | Limited (~$25 specialty sellers) | $21.99 | $24.45 | N/A (kits only) |
| **IBA solution** (100 mL, 1 mg/mL) | Limited (~$20–$25) | $19.99 | ~$23.05 | N/A (kits only) |
| **NAA solution** (100 mL, 1 mg/mL) | Limited (~$25) | $27.99 | $23.40 | N/A (kits only) |

**Cost analysis:**
- **Cheapest individual sourcing:** ~$80–$110 total (depending on NAA inclusion)
- **Starter kit:** $99.99
- **Savings:** $10–$20 if sourcing individually, BUT this doesn't account for:
  - Multiple shipping charges (often $5–$15 per vendor)
  - Time spent sourcing from different suppliers
  - Risk of compatibility issues

**Bottom line:** For beginners, the starter kit's convenience and bundled support often justify the slightly higher cost. For experienced users planning larger operations, individual sourcing from PhytoTech (MS) and PCT (hormones) can save money, especially when buying in bulk.

### 7.3. Is NAA Necessary?

**Short answer:** No, NAA is not essential for most aroid cloning workflows.

**When NAA is used:**
- Some Begonia protocols use NAA alongside BAP for shoot induction
- Alternative to IBA for rooting (though IBA is generally preferred)
- Can be used in combination with IBA for difficult-to-root species

**For Alocasias, Syngoniums, and most Begonias:**
- **BAP** (1–3 mg/L) is sufficient for shoot multiplication
- **IBA** (0.5 mg/L) is effective for rooting
- NAA can be added later if you encounter rooting issues, but it's not required to start

**Recommendation:** If buying individually, start with BAP and IBA only. Add NAA later if needed for specific protocols or troubleshooting.
